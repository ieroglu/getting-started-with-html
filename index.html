  <b>POWER SUPPLY</b><br><br>

Most power plants produce <em>electricity</em> by burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. But burning them can cause air pollution and contribute to climate change. The supply of fossil fuels is also limited. They’re mined from the ground, and eventually, they’ll run out. Wind, on the other hand, is a renewable resource. It doesn’t get used up. That makes it an appealing source of power.

<a href="www.physics.com/html">Wind</a> turbines are used to convert wind energy into <em>electricity</em>. Most turbines look like giant fans sitting on top of towers up to 140 meters (460 feet) high. As <a href="www.physics.com/html">wind</a> pushes the blades, the turning motion powers a generator that makes <em>electricity</em><br><br>

<b>UP, UP, and AWAY</b><br><br>

Conventional wind <img src="http://realinf.com/"alt="turbines">turbines work great on windy days. But if it’s calm, their blades don’t spin, and they can’t produce energy. Turbines that reach higher into the sky would be able to produce energy more reliably. “As you go higher up, the <a href="www.physics.com/html">winds</a> get stronger and steadier,” says atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira of Stanford University, in California. That’s where the floating turbines soon to appear in Fairbanks come in.

<p>The buoyant airborne turbines, or BATs, as they’re called, resemble what you’d get if you were to cross a conventional wind turbine with a blimp. Each one consists of a floating helium-filled shell with a turbine inside. Since helium gas is lighter than air, cables must anchor the system to the ground so it doesn’t float away.</p>

<p>The turbines in Alaska will hover about 300 m (1,000 ft) in the air. That’s more than twice the height of the tallest conventional turbines. “Going a little higher opens up <img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#/media/File:Alternative_Energies.jpg alt="renewable"> renewable energy that’s available cheaply almost anywhere,” says Christina Archer, an engineer who studies wind power at the University of Delaware.</p>
